	  Tool to read/write/update android boot images
	  
	  Android devices use a special partition format to boot any
	  operating system on the devices. These boot-images contain
	  a kernel image, a ramdisk, optionally a 2nd stage boot loader
	  and the commandline passed to the kernel when booting.
	  The original mkbootimg from Android can only create these images
	  where abootimg can also extract and modify them.
	  Handling android boot images is necessary when bringing other
	  operating systems to android devices.
